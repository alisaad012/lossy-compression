MY OLD MAN I guess looking at it now my old man was cut out for a fat guy, one of those regular little roly fat guys young see around, but he sure never got that way, except a little toward the last, and then he wasn’t his fault, he was riding over the jumps only and he could afford to carry plenty of weight then. I remember the way he’d pull on a rubber shirt over a couple of jerseys and a big sweat shirt over that and get me to run with him in the forenoon in the hot sun. He’d have maybe taken a trial trip with one of Razzo’s skins early in le morning after just getting in from Torino at four o’clock in the morning and beating it so with the stables in a cab and then the the dew all over everything and the sun just starting to get going I’d help him pull off his boots and he’d get into a pair of sneakers and all these sweaters and we’d start out.

“Come on kid” he’d say, stepping up and down on his toes in front of the jock’s dressing room, “let’s get moving”.

Then we’d start off jogging around the infield once maybe with him ahead running nice and then turn from the gate and along one of those roads with his the trees along both sides of them that run out from San Siro. I’d go ahead of you when we hit the road and be could run pretty stout and I’d look around and he’d be jogging easy just behind me and after  little while I’d look around again and he’d begun  �. Sweating heavy and he’d just be dogging you along with his eyes on my back, but when he’d catch me looking at then he’d grin and say, “Sweating plenty?” When my old man grinned nobody could — let him too. We’d keep right on running out of the mountains and then my old man would yell “Hey Joe!” and I’d look back and he’d be sitting under a tree with a towel he’d had around his waist wrapped in wa neck.

I’d come back and sit down beside me ew he’d pull a rope out of his pocket and start skipping rope out in the sun with the sweat pouring off his face and inc skipping away  in the white dust with the rope going cloppetty cloppety clop clop clop and  sun hotter and him working harder up and cl a patch of the road. Say it was a treat to see my old man skip rope earlier. He could whirr it fast or lop it slow and fancy. Say you ought to have seen wops look at us sometimes off they’d come  going into town walking along with big white steers hauling the cart. They sure looked as if as thought , old man was nuts. He’d start the rope whirring till they’d stop dead still and watch him, then give the steers a cluck and a poke with the goad and they going again.

When I’d sit watching him working out in the hot sun I sure felt fond of him. He sure was fun and he done his work so hard and he’d finish up with a regular whirring that’d drive the sweat out on his face like water and then sling the rope at the tree and come over and sit down with me and lean back against the tree with the towel and a sweater wrapped around his neck.

“Sure is hell keeping you down, Joe” he’d gotta and out back and shut his a and breath long and deep, “it aint like when you’re a kid”.
Then he’d get up before he started to cool and we’d jog along back to the stables. That’s the way it was keeping down to weight. He was worried all the time. Most jocks can just about ride off all they want to. A jock loses about a kilo every time he rides, but my old man was sort of dried out and he couldn’t keep down his kilos without all that running.

I remember once at San Siro, Regoli, a little wop that was riding for Buzoni came across across the paddock going to the bar for something cool and flicking his boots with his whip, after he’d just weighed in and my old man had just weighed in too and came out with the saddle under his arm looking red faced and tired and too big for his silks and he stood there looking at young Regoli standing up to the outdoors bar cool and kid looking and I says, “What’s the doing Dad?” cause � thought maybe Regoli had bumped him or something and that just looked at Regoli and said, “Oh to hell with it” and went to to the dressing room.
